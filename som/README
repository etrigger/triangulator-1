This program demonstrated the nlogn polygon triangulation algorithm 
outlined in the book "Computational Geometry" by Mark De Berg.
Algorithm consists of two phases: first polygon is split into monotone 
polygons, then each monotone polygon is triangulated in linear time.

The program takes polygon from user as a set of ordered points. Points are 
interactively specified using the mouse. Then it demonstrated steps of the
algorithm needed to split polygon. 

Usage:
after program starts you can quite by pressing ESC or start specifying polygon
using mouse. Left mouse click creates new vertex, middle button closes the 
polygon by joining the first entered vertex with the last one. 
After that vertex types (in terms of triangulation algorithm)  are analyzed 
and displayed using the notation of the book:
rectangle outline -- start vertex
filled rectangle -- end vertex
diamond -- regular vertex
upward facing triangle -- split vertex
downward facing triangle -- merge vertex

After that user can press space bar key to see the next step of the 
triangulation process. Each steps demonstrates current position of the
sweep line and highlights vertex which is intersected by the current position
of the sweep line. When appropriate diagonals splitting polygon into monotone
pieces is displayed.
When all vertices are swept sweep line disappears and triangulation of 
monotone pieces begins. Again each next step happens after user presses space 
bar. The polygon which is currently being split into triangles is highlighted 
as well as current vertex. Again when appropriate diagonals are inserted and
appear on the screen.
